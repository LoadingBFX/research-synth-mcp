# MCP Research Orchestrator

A collaborative AI research system built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables multiple language models to work together on complex research tasks with minimal human intervention.

This project implements a multi-agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to research, analyze, and synthesize information on complex topics. Using the standardized Model Context Protocol, agents maintain context awareness while performing their specialized roles, creating research outputs that combine the strengths of multiple AI models.

## Key Features

- **Specialized Agent Roles**: Separate researcher and synthesizer agents with distinct capabilities
- **Protocol-Based Communication**: Full implementation of MCP for structured agent interaction
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation history with reference chains
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multi-turn workflow for progressive improvement of research quality
- **Minimal Human Intervention**: Autonomous collaboration after initial query

## Use Cases

- Deep research on complex topics requiring both information gathering and critical analysis
- Exploring multifaceted questions with diverse perspectives
- Creating comprehensive analyses that benefit from specialization and iteration
- Building foundation for more complex multi-agent systems

This project demonstrates how specialized AI agents can collaborate more effectively than single models, producing outputs that combine the strengths of different approaches while maintaining coherent context throughout the conversation.
